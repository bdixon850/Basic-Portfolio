        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <p>I'm an aspiring Software Developer who comes from a background in Sales. I have been in Sales for about 10 years, holding several positions before, during and after college. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Information Systems from FAMU in 2012 but decided not to pursue IT as a career until last year. I began feeling strongly about changing my career in 2017 and started looking into different bootcamp options to pursue. With my current job as a Technical Recruiter for an IT staffing firm, we place developers everyday which ultimately sparked a fire in me to change careers. Upon graduation, I plan to obtain a position as a Software Developer and begin my new career.</p>
